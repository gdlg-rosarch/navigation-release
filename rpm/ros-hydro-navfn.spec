%description
navfn provides a fast interpolated navigation function that can be used to
create plans for a mobile base. The planner assumes a circular robot and
operates on a costmap to find a minimum cost plan from a start point to an end
point in a grid. The navigation function is computed with Dijkstra's algorithm,
but support for an A* heuristic may also be added in the near future. navfn also
provides a ROS wrapper for the navfn planner that adheres to the
nav_core::BaseGlobalPlanner interface specified in nav_core.
