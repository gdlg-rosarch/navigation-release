%description
This package provides an implementation of the Dynamic Window Approach to local
robot navigation on a plane. Given a global plan to follow and a costmap, the
local planner produces velocity commands to send to a mobile base. This package
supports any robot who's footprint can be represented as a convex polygon or
cicrle, and exposes its configuration as ROS parameters that can be set in a
launch file. The parameters for this planner are also dynamically
reconfigurable. This package's ROS wrapper adheres to the BaseLocalPlanner
interface specified in the nav_core package.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
