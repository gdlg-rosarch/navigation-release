%description
This package provides implementations of the Trajectory Rollout and Dynamic
Window approaches to local robot navigation on a plane. Given a plan to follow
and a costmap, the controller produces velocity commands to send to a mobile
base. This package supports both holonomic and non-holonomic robots, any robot
footprint that can be represented as a convex polygon or circle, and exposes its
configuration as ROS parameters that can be set in a launch file. This package's
ROS wrapper adheres to the BaseLocalPlanner interface specified in the nav_core
package.
