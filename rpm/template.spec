%description
A 2D navigation stack that takes in information from odometry, sensor streams,
and a goal pose and outputs safe velocity commands that are sent to a mobile
base.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
