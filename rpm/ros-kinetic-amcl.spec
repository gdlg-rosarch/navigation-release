%description
amcl is a probabilistic localization system for a robot moving in 2D. It
implements the adaptive (or KLD-sampling) Monte Carlo localization approach (as
described by Dieter Fox), which uses a particle filter to track the pose of a
robot against a known map. This node is derived, with thanks, from Andrew
Howard's excellent 'amcl' Player driver.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
# set things like CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, PKG_CONFIG_PATH, and PYTHONPATH.
