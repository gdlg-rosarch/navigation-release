ros-hydro-dwa-local-planner (1.11.5-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * Fix for #5 <https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation/issues/5>
  * Parameter to sum scores in DWA Planner
  * Keep consistent allignment_cost scale
    Use the configured alignment cost instead of resetting to 1.0. This
    condition (farther from goal than forward_point_distance) is probably
    met at the start of navigation, it seems this cost should be obeyed
    until the robot gets close, then ignored completely.
  * Cheat factor for end of DWA Plans
  * Change maintainer from Hersh to Lu
